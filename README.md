Contacts app for Android

I created this app for myself, because I work at large company, and having all contacts in my Google Contacts is not the way to go for me.
So now I can pull data from our employee directory and put them into a SQLite database (contacts.s3db) and use it on my phone.

## Features
* Search through thousands of persons blazingly fast without having them in your contacts list.
* Looks up the person who is calling you and tells who it is with a toast and notification, all during ringing.
* Keeps list of recently viewed persons.
